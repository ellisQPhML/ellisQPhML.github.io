## <a name="zhang"></a>"Computation with Tensor Networks",<br /> [**Pan Zhang**](http://home.itp.ac.cn/~panzhang/)

### Abstract

Pan Zhang will present methods and algorithms for solving statistical mechanics problems, combinatorial optimization problems, and quantum circuit simulations,  in an integrated framework based on tensor networks.
In statistical mechanics problems, the partition function at a finite temperature can be obtained by contracting a tensor network that is converted from the statistical mechanics problem. When equipped with the “Tropical” algebra, the tensor network contraction can be used to obtain ground state energy and entropy of the model directly at zero temperature. When the interactions in the statistical mechanics model are complex, computing the partition function acts as estimating the amplitude of a basis vector of the final state of a quantum circuit, thus tensor network contractions can be used to simulate quantum computers. Pan Zhang will introduce approximate and exact algorithms for contracting tensor networks, and their wide applications, particularly in simulating Google’s Sycamore quantum circuits.

### Bio

Pan Zhang is working as a professor at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITP, CAS). He got his Ph.D. from Lanzhou University in 2009 and did post-docs at Turin, Paris and the Santa Fe Institute with Riccardo Zecchina, Florent Krzakala, and Cris Moore, respectively, before joining ITP, CAS in 2015. Pan Zhang’s research is in the interdisciplinary field of statistical physics, machine learning, quantum many-body, and quantum computation.

## <a name="gamba"></a>"Fusion, exploration and unmixing of EO data: challenges and perspectives",<br /> [**Paolo Gamba**](http://tlclab.unipv.it/index.php/people/the-team/23-people/71-paolo-gamba)

### Abstract

The more rich and detailed in terms of spectral, spatial and temporal resolution are the EO data, and the closer to global is the coverage by these data, the more complex are becoming the challenges to achieve a meaningful analysis. This talk intends to explore the major challenges ahead of researchers and practitioners in terms of fusion of EO data at multiple resolutions, EO and non-EO data, EO data exploration in long and complex sequences, and finally with respect to the problem of unmixing hyperspectral data in large geographical areas.

### Bio

Paolo Gamba is Professor at the University of Pavia, Italy, where he leads the Telecommunications and Remote Sensing Laboratory.  He has been working for more than 25 years in urban remote sensing applications, addressing the need to analyze large amounts of data from multiple satellites, from radar to multispectral, from hyperspectral to thermal, always considering a global perspective. He has been invited to give keynote lectures and tutorials on several occasions about urban remote sensing, data fusion, EO data for physical exposure and risk management. He published more than 170 papers in international peer-review journals.

## <a name="vlatko"></a>"The current state of quantum computing",<br /> [**Vedral Vlatko**](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/vedral)

### Abstract

I will review the basics of quantum computing and talk about different qubit platforms that are currently being pursued. I will also comment on different models of quantum computation and mention their advantages and disadvantages. In the short term, various small-scale quantum subroutines might find useful applications within the existing hybrid quantum-classical regime. However, in the long term, the quantum search algorithm will offer a ubiquitous speed-up. Applications range from quantum metrology to simulations of complex systems, including weather forecast and financial quantitative analysis.

## <a name="michielsen"></a>"Quantum classical hybrid computing models in modular HPC systems with potential applications in Earth Observation",<br /> [**Kristel Michielsen**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/IAS/JSC/EN/staff/michielsen_k.html)

### Abstract

Quantum computing and quantum annealing are new, innovative ways of computing for some of the most complex problems with potential applications in simulation, optimization and machine learning. The expectations for the use of quantum computers and quantum annealers in science and industry are high. Although it will still take many years for quantum computing technology to become fully mature, an early entry into the practical use of this new disruptive technology is of great urgency.

Practical application requires the integration of quantum computers into existing HPC infrastructures in the form of quantum-classical hybrid computing models. The “Jülich UNified Infrastructure for Quantum computing (JUNIQ)”, a quantum computer user facility which is set up at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), will integrate quantum computing devices with various quantum technology readiness levels into the modular supercomputing architecture of JSC. Within JUNIQ, user support and training in HPC and quantum computer usage will be provided, software tools, modelling concepts and algorithms will be developed, and it will play an important role in the development of prototype applications.

We also discuss some preliminary results for prototype Earth-Observation applications, which are based on quantum-classical classification and regression algrithms for remote sensing data.

Since 2009 she is group leader of the research group Quantum Information Processing at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre, Forschungszentrum Jülich (Germany) and is also Professor of Quantum Information Processing at RWTH Aachen University (Germany).
Kristel Michielsen and her research group have ample experience in performing large-scale simulations of quantum systems. She has expertise in, on the one hand simulating quantum computers and quantum annealers, and on the other hand in benchmarking and studying prototype applications for this new compute technology by using the various quantum computing and quantum annealing systems that are nowadays available. Together with Prof. Lippert she is building up the JUNIQ infrastructure at the JSC.
