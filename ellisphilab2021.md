# Aims and Scope

Quantum Computing has the potential of revolutionising information processing and becoming a key-enabler for yet unsolved technological and scientific problems. Recent advances in quantum physics and quantum algorithms make this game-changing turn even more likely.

Quantum computers will redefine parallel and probabilistic computing, and thus will allow to make complex computations in a considerably reduced time. In terms of data analytics, they will enable us to sample and explore huge volumes of scattered data, to identify and retrieve specific patterns, and optimize functionals for all kinds of use-cases. In terms of physics simulation, they will enable solving partial differential equations with applications to e.g. fluid dynamics. Today, thanks to progress in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and classical-quantum hybrid computing, promising approaches are already tested on real machines.

Earth Observation (EO) allows gathering of global information about our planet Earth’s physical, chemical and biological systems via satellites carrying remote sensing devices. The most recurrent issue in EO science is the solution of inverse, ill-conditioned problems, which typically include specific land-cover identification, biophysical parameter estimation and feature extraction, atmospheric inverse problems, gravimetry, etc. EO needs the unprecedented power of Quantum Computing to face current challenges in processing of Earth system measurements and data.
